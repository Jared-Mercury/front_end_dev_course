    <h1>Rite of Passage</h1>
    <p>The crazy beeping of an alarm clock puts an end to a weird nightmare I was having. I am glad that it’s over but I still try to cover my ears with a pillow out of habit. The annoying sound continues and the pillow isn’t doing a great job muffing it
        so I finally decide to crawl out from under the comfy sheets. I sit up on the bed and stretch before whamming the clock with an open hand to snooze it. The card that was about to flip to show me the current time <span>got stuck</span> and kept
        going back and forth for a few seconds before finally flipping into place. </p>
