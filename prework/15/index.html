        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>In January 2015, the Arkansas Times profiled a local woman in a soaring portrait titled “Ruth Coker Burks, the cemetery angel.” The nearly 4,500-word cover story recounted how Burks “cared for hundreds of people whose families had abandoned them”
            at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, an epidemic that between the years of 1983 and 2019 killed about 3,900 people in the state of Arkansas, according to the Hot Springs AIDS Resource Center. Burks detailed how she buried dozens
            of gay men in a cemetery where her family owned plots when they succumbed to the disease. The paper’s epic tale — a story of “courage, love and the 30-year secret of one little graveyard in Hot Springs” — draws on the heartstrings with anecdotes
            of fearless courage in the daunting face of stigma and discrimination. That article inspired countless other media outlets, including TODAY (once in 2019 and then again earlier this year), to profile Burks over the past six years, but as her
            story spread, so have concerns over its veracity. In July 2021, the Arkansas Times revisited Burks in an article titled "Ruth Coker Burks and the missing monument," addressing concerns some people have raised with her story. After becoming
            aware of the Arkansas Times article, TODAY conducted more than a dozen interviews with Hot Springs locals and those with ties to the now 62-year-old. Many questioned her account of working “with over a thousand people” dying of AIDS, owning
            more than 200 plots in the local Files Cemetery and intending to build a monument to honor the men she says she buried with money raised from a GoFundMe campaign. Burks declined an interview with TODAY through her lawyer, Toni Long. When asked
            about these concerns, Burks’ attorney told TODAY in a statement that her client’s “health and medical needs contributed to the delay with the project” and that Burks fully intends “to get this project completed.”</p>
